# Stealth Engine

A 2D game engine written in C++ for development in C++. Supported platforms for both development and build are Linux, OSX, Windows.

This is a personal project I am working on for training purpose. This project started as a framework I intended to use for a top-view Stealth game with a variety of AI applications, but it gradually turned into a generic 2D engine.
