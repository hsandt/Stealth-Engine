// This file *only* contains the definition of CATCH_CONFIG_MAIN and the catch header
// This is done by including catch_with_main.hpp but could be done inline too
// This should be done only once with the whole test project, to avoid recompiling
// the whole header of Catch when small changes occur (so this file must never change)

#include "catch_with_main.hpp"
